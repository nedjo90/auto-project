# Story 6.4: Empty State & Seller Onboarding

**Epic:** 6 - Cockpit Vendeur & Intelligence Marché
**FRs:** FR36
**NFRs:** —

## User Story

As a new seller,
I want clear guidance when my cockpit is empty,
So that I know exactly what to do first and feel welcomed rather than lost.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a seller with zero listings accesses their cockpit (FR36)
**When** the dashboard loads
**Then** an engaging empty state is displayed (not a blank page)
**And** two clear CTAs are shown: "Publiez votre premier véhicule" and "Explorez le marché"
**And** the message tone is inviting and encouraging (UX principle: empty state = invitation)

**Given** a seller publishes their first listing
**When** they return to the cockpit
**Then** the empty state is replaced by the full dashboard with KPIs
